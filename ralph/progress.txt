Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Set up Next.js project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Configured shadcn/ui with necessary dependencies (clsx, tailwind-merge)
- Created components.json configuration for shadcn/ui
- Updated package.json with proper name and type-check script
- Removed legacy Deno/Playwright files that were causing type errors
- Verified type checking passes successfully
- Created updated README.md for the Next.js project
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This codebase now uses Next.js 14+ with App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui
  - Bun is the preferred runtime/package manager
  - Legacy Deno files needed to be removed to avoid type conflicts
  - The project follows a mobile-first approach with PWA capabilities

## Sun Jan 18 17:45:00 PST 2026 - US-002
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Set up SQLite database with Drizzle ORM using bun:sqlite (since better-sqlite3 is not supported in Bun)
- Created database configuration at lib/db/index.ts
- Created Drizzle configuration at drizzle.config.ts
- Created placeholder schema file at lib/db/schema.ts
- Added database-related scripts to package.json
- Created type declaration file for bun:sqlite module
- Updated tsconfig.json to include custom type declarations
- Verified type checking passes successfully
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This codebase uses bun:sqlite instead of better-sqlite3 due to Bun runtime compatibility
  - Custom type declarations are needed for Bun-specific modules
  - The database configuration follows a standard Drizzle ORM setup with SQLite
  - Migration system is configured and ready for schema changes
