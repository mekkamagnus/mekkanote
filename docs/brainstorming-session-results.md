Brainstorming Session: Note-Taking Application

Executive Summary

- Session Topic: Brainstorming ideas for a new note-taking application.
- Constraints: TypeScript, HTMX, Nunjucks, SQLite, CherryUI, org-mode files, for dogfooding.
- Goal: Broad exploration to generate ideas for a comprehensive PRD.
- Techniques Used: Question Storming, Thematic Analysis, and Priority-Based Synthesis.
- Key Themes Identified: Core Functionality & Note Intelligence, Integration & Extensibility, User Experience & UI, and Technical
  Architecture & Performance.

Technique: Question Storming

We generated the following questions to explore the problem space:

- What if the note-taking app could automatically link related ideas from different notes?
- How could the app help users who are not familiar with org-mode syntax?
- How can static org documents be integrated into the system?
- How can emacs interact with this note-taking app?
- What if the app could automatically pull in to-do items from org files and display them on a separate, consolidated "Tasks"
  page?
- How can I best employ Zettelkasten and evergreen note philosophies in this app?
- How can I handle small previews of links from other sites?
- How can I use browser storage and PWA to make a faster app?
- How can using Deno help this project?
- What if those links could be visualized as a graph?
- What if the app could sync changes back and forth with the original static org files on the filesystem?
- What if the app could render org-mode tables as interactive data grids?
- What if the app provided an API that Emacs packages could use to push and pull notes?
- What if the app could proactively surface notes that are conceptually related but not yet linked?
- What if the app could automatically save an offline copy of a linked webpage to prevent link rot?
- What if, in addition to a preview, the app could pull the full text of a linked article into the note for offline reading and
  annotation?
- What if the app was designed to be 'offline-first'?
- What if using Deno allowed us to write backend and frontend code with a more unified toolchain?
- What if using Deno could simplify our entire development environment and build process?

Action Planning

Top Priority Ideas
The following interconnected ideas were identified as the highest priority for the initial version of the application:

1.  Employ Zettelkasten and evergreen note philosophies.
2.  Automatically link related ideas from different notes.
3.  Proactively surface conceptually related but unlinked notes.

Immediate Next Step

- Define the linking strategy: Determine the technical and philosophical approach for how notes will be linked, stored, and
  surfaced. This includes deciding on automatic vs. manual linking, the data structures required, and the algorithms for
  identifying related content.
