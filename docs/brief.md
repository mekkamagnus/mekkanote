# Project Brief: MekkaNote - The AI-Powered Note-Taking Assistant

## Executive Summary

MekkaNote is an intelligent note-taking application I'm building for my own personal use to better manage my knowledge and creative workflow. Heavily inspired by Zettelkasten, atomic notes, and evergreen note-taking philosophies, the goal is to solve the problem of my own disorganized and underutilized notes. It will use AI to automatically tag, categorize, summarize, and create a web of knowledge through automatic backlinking. The system will proactively suggest links between related but previously unconnected notes, fostering a Zettelkasten-like environment. The key value proposition is to transform my personal note-taking from passive storage into a dynamic, intelligent knowledge management system that helps me think, create, and discover connections within my own information.

## Inspiration

This project draws inspiration from several leading note-taking and knowledge management tools:

- **Obsidian:** For its powerful linking and graph-based visualization of notes.
- **Logseq:** For its outliner-based approach and focus on daily journals.
- **Apple Notes:** For its simplicity, ease of use, and seamless integration across devices.

## Problem Statement

While I'm inspired by knowledge management systems like Zettelkasten and atomic notes, my attempts to implement them with existing tools are fraught with friction. The manual effort required to consistently create links, tag notes appropriately, and ensure ideas are properly connected is significant and unsustainable. My digital notes often become a 'write-only' mediumâ€”a graveyard of good ideas that are never resurfaced because the connections between them are not obvious or easy to make. Existing tools are passive; they don't actively help me build the web of knowledge I'm aiming for. This leads to lost insights and a failure to capitalize on the compounding value of a well-connected, evergreen note system.

## Proposed Solution

To combat the friction of manual knowledge management, MekkaNote will be an AI-augmented tool built around a clean, intuitive note-taking interface. As I write, an AI engine will work alongside me, suggesting tags, generating summaries, and, most importantly, recommending links to other relevant notes in my collection. The core concept is "AI-assisted Zettelkasten," where the system automates the tedious parts of building a connected knowledge base. It will proactively surface connections I might have missed, turning my static notes into a dynamic, interactive, and self-organizing system that facilitates insight and creativity.

### My User Profile

- **Profile:** I am a developer and thinker who wants to build a long-term, personal knowledge base. I am passionate about philosophies like Zettelkasten and evergreen notes.
- **Behaviors:** I consume a lot of information from various sources (articles, books, conversations) and need a frictionless way to capture and connect ideas. I often work on multiple projects and need to be able to pull insights from my collected knowledge.
- **Needs:** I need a tool that removes the manual labor of maintaining a connected notes system. It should help me see the links between my ideas, resurface old thoughts, and provide a space for creative, associative thinking without the overhead of constant manual organization.

### Project Goals & Milestones

#### Personal Goals

- **Reduce Friction:** Significantly decrease the time and effort it takes to create and link notes.
- **Increase Insight:** Actively use the tool to generate at least one new, unexpected connection between ideas each week.
- **Consistent Use:** Successfully use this as my primary note-taking tool for at least one month, validating its usefulness for my workflow.

#### Project Milestones

- **Milestone 1 (Core Linking & Context):**
  - Build a basic note-taking app where I can create, edit, and save notes.
  - Implement manual linking by typing `[[` to trigger a dropdown with real-time search results of existing notes. When a note is selected, the link is created, and a corresponding backlink automatically appears in the linked note's backlink section.
  - When pasting a social media link (e.g., Twitter, YouTube), automatically unfurl it to show a content preview (like the tweet text or video thumbnail).
- **Milestone 2 (AI Integration):** Integrate the AI engine to provide automatic tagging and _suggestions_ for new links I might have missed.
- **Milestone 3 (Dogfooding):** Use the app as my daily driver for two weeks and compile a list of friction points and improvements.
- **Milestone 4 (Refinement):** Implement the key improvements identified during the dogfooding phase.

### MVP Scope

The scope of the Minimum Viable Product is to build the core functionality defined in **Milestone 1** and **Milestone 2**.

#### Core Features (In Scope for MVP)

- **Note Management:** Create, edit, and save `.org` format notes with full support for:
  - Headlines (H1-H6) with folding/unfolding
  - Dates and timestamps
  - Org-mode tags
  - Properties and property drawers
  - Bullet and numbered lists
  - Light org-mode syntax highlighting
  - Image storage using local file references (following Obsidian/Logseq conventions)
- **Manual Bi-directional Linking:**
  - Initiate linking with `[[` to open a real-time note search modal.
  - If no existing note is found, create a new note directly from the search modal.
  - Create links using UUID-based references (following org-mode conventions).
  - Automatically create corresponding backlinks in referenced notes.
- **Link Unfurling:** Automatically show a preview for pasted social media links (e.g., Twitter, YouTube).
- **AI-Powered Suggestions:**
  - Automatic tagging of notes based on content.
  - Suggestions for new links between notes.
  - **Basic Search:** A simple text-based search to find notes by title or content.

#### Out of Scope for MVP

- Advanced AI features (e.g., summarization, natural language query).
- Real-time collaboration or multi-user features.
- Third-party application integrations.
- Advanced search filters.
