## Mon Jan 19 14:47:08 CST 2026 - US-041
Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented edit note page at /notes/[id]/edit
- Page pre-fills form with existing note title and content
- Added submit button that updates note via PUT /api/notes/[id]
- Added cancel button that returns to note detail page
- Implemented redirect to note detail page on success
- Added loading and error states
- Files changed: /app/notes/[id]/edit/page.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This codebase uses Next.js App Router with TypeScript
  - Components are organized in the /components/ui directory
  - The edit page follows the same patterns as other pages in the app
  - API routes follow REST conventions (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Pages use shadcn/ui components for consistent UI
