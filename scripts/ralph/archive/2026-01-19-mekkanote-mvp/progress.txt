### $(date) - US-042: Migrated to DeepSeek API
**Changes Made:**
- Updated env.ts: Changed from OPENAI_API_KEY to DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
- Updated lib/ai/config.ts: Configured DeepSeek client with baseURL 'https://api.deepseek.com'
- Updated lib/services/ai-service.ts: Changed from 'gpt-4o-mini' to 'deepseek-chat' model
- Updated lib/services/embedding-service.ts: Replaced OpenAI embeddings with text-based Jaccard similarity (DeepSeek doesn't provide embeddings API)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Tag suggestions working: DeepSeek API returns relevant tags
- ✅ Link suggestions working: Text-based similarity finds related notes
- ✅ Dev server starts successfully
- ✅ No runtime errors

**Notes:**
- DeepSeek has OpenAI-compatible API, so minimal code changes were needed
- For embeddings, implemented Jaccard similarity algorithm as fallback
- AI features now fully functional with DeepSeek
