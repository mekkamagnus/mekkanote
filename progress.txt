## Codebase Patterns
- Use Drizzle ORM for database operations with SQLite
- Use shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- Use `@/` alias for absolute imports from project root
- Components should be placed in `/components/ui` directory
- Database schema defined in `/lib/db/schema.ts`

- Creating note model and schema
- Setting up database schema with Drizzle ORM
- Adding notes table with required fields
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This codebase uses Drizzle ORM with SQLite for database operations
  - Schema file is located at `/lib/db/schema.ts`
  - Need to run `bun run db:generate` and `bun run db:push` to update database
  - The dev.db file is used for development environment

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented note model and schema with Drizzle ORM
- Created database migration and pushed schema to SQLite
- Added database connection utility
- Completed type-checking and linting
- Files changed: lib/db/schema.ts, lib/db/index.ts, env.ts, drizzle.config.ts

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/$AMP_CURRENT_THREAD_ID
- Implemented CRUD operations for notes
- Created API routes for GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE operations
- Added proper validation and error handling
- Files changed: app/api/notes/route.ts, app/api/notes/[id]/route.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:** 
  - Next.js 16+ wraps dynamic route params in Promises
  - API routes should handle errors gracefully and return appropriate HTTP status codes
  - Use Drizzle ORM methods like .returning() to get updated records

- Designed note creation UI with shadcn components
- Created NoteCreationForm component with validation
- Added create note page at /notes/create
- Files changed: components/note-creation-form.tsx, app/notes/create/page.tsx, plus shadcn components
- **Learnings for future iterations:** 
  - Install shadcn components using 'npx shadcn add component-name'
  - Use 'use client' directive for components that use React hooks
  - Form submissions should handle loading states and errors
