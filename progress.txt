## Codebase Patterns
- Use Drizzle ORM for database operations with SQLite
- Use shadcn/ui components for UI elements
- Use `@/` alias for absolute imports from project root
- Components should be placed in `/components/ui` directory
- Database schema defined in `/lib/db/schema.ts`

- Creating note model and schema
- Setting up database schema with Drizzle ORM
- Adding notes table with required fields
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - This codebase uses Drizzle ORM with SQLite for database operations
  - Schema file is located at `/lib/db/schema.ts`
  - Need to run `bun run db:generate` and `bun run db:push` to update database
  - The dev.db file is used for development environment
